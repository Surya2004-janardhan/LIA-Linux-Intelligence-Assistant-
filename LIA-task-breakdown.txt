# WIA (Windows Intelligence Assistant) - 10-PHASE IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT (LOCAL-FIRST)

This document breaks down the development of WIA into 10 distinct, logical phases to ensure a stable, high-performance, and deeply integrated Windows assistant.

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & LOCAL LLM BRIDGE
**Goal**: Establish the project plumbing and the connection to local intelligence.
1. Initialize the project structure: `/agents`, `/core`, `/ui`, `/memory`.
2. Implement the `LLMBridge`: Create a unified interface for Ollama (local) and OpenAI-compatible APIs (optional).
3. Configuration Layer: Create a local `.yaml` or `.json` config to store user preferences, model choices, and API keys.
4. Setup Logging: Detailed local logging for debugging agent tracks.

## PHASE 2: SEMANTIC MEMORY & LOCAL RAG
**Goal**: Make WIA "smart" about the user's files without cloud dependencies.
1. Implement the Indexer: Use `sentence-transformers` to generate embeddings for file paths, names, and command templates.
2. Vector Storage: Integrate `FAISS` or `ChromaDB` as a 100% local database.
3. Search Logic: Create the retrieval mechanism that finds relevant files or commands based on natural language queries (the "85% Cache" strategy).

## PHASE 3: THE CORE AGENT FACTORY (AGENT SWARM ORCHESTRATOR)
**Goal**: Build the brain that decides which agent to call.
1. Base Agent Class: Define the standard for tools, observation, and thought processes.
2. Planner Logic: Implement the LangChain ReAct (Reason + Act) loop.
3. Tool Registry: A central hub where all agents register their Windows CLI tools.

## PHASE 4: THE SPECIALISTS - FILE & SYSTEM AGENTS
**Goal**: Give WIA the ability to manipulate the filesystem and monitor the system.
1. FileAgent: Implement tools for `find`, `rsync`, `fdupes`, and `mkdir`.
2. SysAgent: Implement tools for `psutil` (monitoring) and `systemctl` (services).
3. Permissions Bridge: Develop the bridge that detects when `sudo` is needed and requests it safely via the UI.

## PHASE 5: THE SPECIALISTS - GIT, NET & WEB AGENTS
**Goal**: Expand WIA's reach to code, networks, and the web.
1. GitAgent: Integrate `git` commands and the `gh` (GitHub CLI) for PR management.
2. NetAgent: Add network diagnostic tools like `nmap`, `ping`, and `ss`.
3. WebAgent: Focus on "Deep-Linking"—launching browser tabs or email clients with specific contexts via `xdg-open`.

## PHASE 6: YAML WORKFLOW ENGINE & AUTOMATION
**Goal**: Move from single commands to complex routines.
1. Parser: Create a parser for the WIA YAML specification.
2. Execution Engine: Implement sequential and parallel task execution.
3. Safety Check: Dry-run mode to show the user exactly what commands will be run before they execute.

## PHASE 7: STUNNING CONTROL CENTER UI (FLET)
**Goal**: Create a premium, high-FPS graphical interface.
1. Spotlight Interface: A lightweight, global-shortcut "Command Palette" for queries.
2. Agent Visualizer: Real-time "bubbles" or feeds showing what agents are currently thinking or doing.
3. Dark Mode / Glassmorphism: Implement the "Wow" factor aesthetics using custom CSS/Flet themes.

## PHASE 8: TERMINAL UI (TUI) & SHELL INTEGRATION
**Goal**: Make WIA accessible for power users and remote SSH sessions.
1. TUI Implementation: Build a high-performance terminal interface using `Textual`.
2. Shell AWIAses: Create the `WIA` command-line bridge for Bash/Zsh.
3. Background Guardian: A lightweight daemon that monitors SSD health/disk space and "pings" the TUI/GUI.

## PHASE 9: SECURITY SANDBOXING & AUDIT LOGS
**Goal**: Ensure WIA can never harm the system unintentionally.
1. Firejail Profiling: Wrap sensitive CLI tools in `firejail` sandboxes.
2. Local Audit DB: Store every command run by WIA in a searchable SQLite database for user review.
3. Rollback Implementation: Integrate with `rsync` or `snapper` to allow users to "undo" file organization tasks.

## PHASE 10: PACKAGING & ECOSYSTEM LAUNCH
**Goal**: Distribution and community readiness.
1. Packaging: Build AppImage, Flatpak, and native packages (AUR/Flatpak).
2. Workflow Marketplace: Setup a local "Studio" where users can export/import YAML workflows.
3. Launch Readiness: Finalize documentation (README, Wiki) and prepare for the HN/Reddit release.
